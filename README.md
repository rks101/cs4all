Computer Science and Engineering are for all to learn, explore and enable interesting innovations - the most important one is **problem solving**. We explore and share pointers on how to get started quickly and continue a self-paced journey.   

Regardless of the background, you can explore a course [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) by Prof David Malan (.../2021/2022). Prof David is an awesome instructor at introducing concepts and engaging the students. Malan's energy level keeps you connected, which you will surely enjoy and remember. The best part is: it is free! Notice how he uses two laptops, two displays with a switcher, and bit-bulbs are fun.   

Whether you are a sophomore, a senior undergrad, or a fresh student for a college degree, without any hesitation, you can take this lovely course [CS50's Understanding Technology](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/). You should also explore [CS50 CyberSecurity live course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Bki7QEz2M). [Software Construction](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/) course at MIT Fall 2015 is interesting and covers good ground.    

Note:- Your health is very important, especially your eyes, neck, back, fingers, and wrists, while you type a lot on computing devices. If you use a computer desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone for more than 3 hours or more daily, repetitive strain injury (RSI) may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. Merely a bad and fixed posture can cause fatigue and pain in later years if ignored for a long time. Please take a break often (from work, studies, city), and do exercises and stretches. This page from [Princeton UHS](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help in simple reflexes, especially watching videos under the section **Desk Stretching Exercises** (you may need to fix the loading of Kaltura videos in your browser).

You can teach CS for yourself, literally. Explore [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com)

[OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) shows a path to self-taught and self-paced education in Computer Science. There is a curated curriculum, fundamental concepts in Core CS, and a platform for discussion with other students. 

A [Scripting Course](https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting_course#ebooks) for a primer on Linux, Scripting, Vim, Perl, etc. 

Some [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) are available online for reference.   

After the first CS or programming course, refer to [CS Video Courses](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses).   

[RUST programming for beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rust-programming-course-for-beginners/)    

[Harold Abelson's video lectures on Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Programs and beyond](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/)     

[First Principle thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)    

**On too many resources available online**:    
People may experience too-much-stuff-syndrome. Great content can help you learn better, so you must filter great content from not-so-great content! While learning cybersecurity topics, you may get lost in [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/). The same goes for algorithms, computer networking, and operating systems. Plan for a month or a quarter, and then return to topics that interest you. You should write and share pages like these too :) Writing online is a great habit and rewarding too. I started on GitHub with self-reference notes; in less than a year, there was something to share.

**First programming language**   

Q. Often, this question is brought up around curriculum rejig or for new first-year admissions - what should be the first programming language that should be taught at the campus to new undergrads?   

A. Rather than teaching a single programming language to first-year undergrads (mostly common for all students or for a mix of disciplines), we can pick up something that teaches problem-solving and helps visualize the bare-bone structure of programs. We can start with Scratch drag-and-drop, then introduce any interpreter (without an IDE/GUI) or an online playground, then solve problems using C or Scheme. In the last part, we can introduce some web programming interfaces using online playgrounds and, finally, a scripting language. In this initial journey, we should pick problems around us, create an abstraction for smaller tasks, and try to find solutions using code. For students: developing logic is more important than how many programs you write daily.

Writing tools to create Musical Docs   

Students and developers should inculcate a habit of writing notes for issues encountered and helping themselves and others. Most of my pages have come online because I wanted these notes to be available to me anytime, anywhere, or someone asked me the same questions over time.    

Like online GitHub pages, you can learn Latex quickly and create nice presentations.    

LaTeX: [tutorial](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/) and a [Latexsheet](http://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet-a4.pdf).    
[Overleaf](overleaf.com) - an online LaTeX editor that is very handy without the hassle of installing locally on the laptop/desktop. Free and Student versions of Overleaf are great too.
