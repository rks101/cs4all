Computer Science and Engineering are for all to learn, explore and enable interesting innovations - the most important one is **problem solving**.   

We explore and share pointers on how to get started quickly and continue a self-paced journey.   

Regardless of the background, you can explore a course [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) by Prof David Malan (.../2021/2022).   
Prof David is awesome at introducing concepts and engaging the students. Malan's energy level keeps you connected, and it is that you will love and remember. The best things in the world are free! Notice how he uses two laptops, two displays with a switcher, and bit-bulbs are fun.   

Whether you are a sophomore or a senior undergrad, or a fresh student in the college for a UG/PG degree, without any hesitation, you can take this lovely course [CS50's Understanding Technology](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/). You should also explore [CS50 CyberSecurity live course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Bki7QEz2M).    

[Software Construction](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/) course at MIT Fall 2015.   

Note:- Your health is very important, especially your eyes, neck, back, fingers, and wrists if type a lot. If you are using a computer desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone for more than 3 hours or more every day, repetitive strain injury may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. Merely a bad posture, if ignored for a long, can cause fatigue and pain later. Please take a break often, and do exercises and stretches. This page from [Princeton UHS](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help in simple reflexes, especially watching videos under the section **Desk Stretching Exercises**.
